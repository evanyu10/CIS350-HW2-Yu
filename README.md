## Technical Background:
I have been programming since my senior year of high school and my first introduction to programming was through the AP Computer Science class. I started with learning Java, but after I finished my coursework, I started to dabble in python and javascript. I have done a few different projects since learning to program, but I have not really done many projects with collaboration. I am familiar with GitHub and the importance of it, but I have not used it for any personal projects yet.

Here is my favorite meme: https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F680325087464623384%2F&psig=AOvVaw1ty9TwjB6-AZdYENu5-YKI&ust=1664309422282000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAwQjRxqFwoTCKjOofGhs_oCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD
